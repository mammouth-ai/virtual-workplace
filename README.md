# virtual-workplace

This repository is the output of a Mammouth Code session with DeepSeek v3.2 model, to demonstrate what is possible.

Prompt (with grammar errors):
```
Generate a 2D pixel-mode style virtual coworking space, where two people can connect talk to each other when they are close on the map. Keep things minimalistic so that it can run on localhost. User characters can simply a human head and the map cover in grass. Use python to make the game.
```
